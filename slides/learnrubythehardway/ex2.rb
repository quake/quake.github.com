# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# The # in that code is inside a string,
# so it will be put into the string until the ending " character is hit. 
puts "Hi # there."
